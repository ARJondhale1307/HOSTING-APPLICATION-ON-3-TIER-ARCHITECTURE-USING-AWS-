# HOSTING-APPLICATION-ON-3-TIER-ARCHITECTURE-USING-AWS-
## Introduction:

In this project, I create a 3-tier architecture for host application and database.  Three-tier architecture is a well-established software application architecture that organizes applications into three logical and physical computing tiers: the jump-server tier, or user interface; the application tier, where data is processed; and the database tier, where application data is stored and managed.
## Prerequisite:
1. Basic understanding of AWS and Mysql. 
2. SHH key.
3. Knowledge about linux commands.
